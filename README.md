# DCSUpdater
Welcome to my DCSUpdater Repo!

A friend was having a hell of a time trying to get the built-in DCS_Updater executable working properly to update his DCS install, and with the changes in Windows 10 that push users to using PowerShell instead of Command Prompt, I figured it might be helpful to have a PowerShell script to do the different tasks.

By all means check out SkateZilla's GUI interface if you'd like a fancier updating utility, but for me personally give me a simple command line interface that just works and I'm a happy camper :)

I'm leaving the script open so users can see exactly what it does and I'll try to comment my code as efficiently as possible to outline exactly what each piece is doing.

I am also by no means a PowerShell wizard, I just know how to use it for some random things and script in some creative solutions, so if anyone has any suggestions/edits I'll happily add some users to the project.

Thanks and enjoy!

# TO RUN

To run the script, just download it to a convenient directory on your machine (anywhere works) and right click the script and select "Run with PowerShell".

From there, I've added dialogs to the script that wil walk you through the process!
