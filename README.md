# DCSUpdater
Welcome to my DCSUpdater Repo!

A friend was having a hell of a time trying to get the built-in DCS_Updater executable working properly to update his DCS install, and with the changes in Windows 10 that push users to using PowerShell instead of Command Prompt, I figured it might be helpful to have a PowerShell script to do the different tasks.

I'm leaving the script open so users can see exactly what it does and I'll try to comment my code as efficiently as possible to outline exactly what each piece is doing.

I am also by no means a PowerShell wizard, I just know how to use it for some random things and script in some creative solutions, so if anyone has any suggestions/edits I'll happily add some users to the project.

Thanks and enjoy!
